# Geospatial analysis with SF 

## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2023. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-23) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2023.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the geocoding workflow with R and sf. Geocoding is the computational process by which a physical address is converted into geographic coordinates. sf is a package used for working with geospatial data, enabling the creation, manipulation, and analysis of spatial data like points, lines, and polygons.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the sf package and geocoding workflow, (2) show you some key verbs and collaborations with other packages, and (3) provide you with practice material and further readings.
