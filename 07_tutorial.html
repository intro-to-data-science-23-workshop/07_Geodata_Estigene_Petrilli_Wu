<p>Geocoding with sf can be a lot of fun. Geocoding is the computational process by which a physical address is converted into geographic coordinates. sf is a package used for working with geospatial data, enabling the creation, manipulation, and analysis of spatial data like points, lines, and polygons. 


<code>stringr</code> and wrap up with regular expressions.</p>

<p>Why should you learn geocoding? Here we insert reasons why. </p>

<p>Lets' try to run some examples using <code>sf</code> , shall we? This is some example i got from chatGPT for demostration purpuses. In our actual example, this would be introducing a verb in sf and showing people how to use it</p>

  
  <p>Here's an example of R code:</p>
  
  <pre><code>
    # This is a simple R script
    x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    mean_value <- mean(x)
    print(mean_value)
  </code></pre>
